Hi <%= @pick.requester.first_name %>,

Good news – we’ve scheduled your <%= PickView.tree_type(@pick) %> pick for <%= SharedView.friendly_date(@pick.scheduled_date) %> from <%= SharedView.twelve_hour_time(@pick.scheduled_start_time) %> to <%= SharedView.twelve_hour_time(@pick.scheduled_end_time) %>!

<%= @pick.lead_picker.first_name %> and their team of Fruit Pickers will arrive on site and pick as much as they can for 2 hours. After the pick, <%= @pick.lead_picker.first_name %> will be delivering ⅓ of the fruit by cargo bike to <%= @pick.agency.name %>. No need to be home, unless there’s something that needs to be unlocked for the team to access your tree.

Please leave out:

- A yard waste bag or green bin to dispose of rotten fruit
- A container for your share of the fruit (if you’d like some!)
- A ladder (if you don’t have one please do your best to borrow from a neighbour!)

For your reference, the Pick ID for this pick is: <%= @pick.id%>

If you need to reschedule your pick for any reason (i.e. the fruit’s not ready yet), <%= Routes.pick_url(Endpoint, :request_reschedule, @pick) %>. We’ll do our best to reschedule your pick, but please keep in mind that this depends on the availability of our Fruit Pickers and Pick Leaders.

If you need to cancel your pick (i.e. weather or critters got to your fruit first) <%= Routes.pick_url(Endpoint, :request_cancel, @pick) %>.

Thank you so much for sharing your fruit with your community and supporting Not Far From The Tree!


Fruitfully yours,

The NFFTT Team
