Hi <%= @agency.contact_name %>,

Unfortunately the fruit (<%= Recase.to_title(PickView.tree_type(@pick) || "unknown") %>) delivery that was scheduled for <%= SharedView.friendly_date(@pick.scheduled_date) %> shortly after <%= SharedView.twelve_hour_time(@pick.scheduled_end_time) %> has been cancelled.

Weâ€™re so sorry for the inconvenience, and will do our best to send out another delivery of fruit your way soon!

Fruitfully yours,

The NFFTT Team
